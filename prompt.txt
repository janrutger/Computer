A great and logical next step would be to implement a buffered keyboard input system and a corresponding "read line" system call.

Hereâ€™s why this is a nice next step and what it would involve:

Why this is the right next step:
Improves User Experience: The current keyboard interrupt routine (@KBD_ISR) just prints a character directly to the screen. A buffered system would allow you to type ahead, and more importantly, to implement features like backspace to correct mistakes before hitting 'Enter'. This makes the command line infinitely more usable.
Enables Real Programs: Your kernel's command interpreter and any future programs you write will need a way to get structured input from the user (e.g., "run my_program"). A "read line" system call is the most fundamental way to do this.
Builds on Existing Infrastructure: You already have an interrupt handler for the keyboard. This task involves making that handler more intelligent, which is a natural evolution of the existing code.
It's a Core OS Feature: All operating systems have a mechanism for buffered I/O. Implementing this is a classic and essential step in kernel development.
How to implement it:
Create a Keyboard Buffer: In os_kernel.asm or a new include file, define a circular buffer in memory. This is just a fixed-size area of memory to store keystrokes. You'll also need pointers or indices to keep track of the "head" (where to write the next key) and "tail" (where to read the next key).

Enhance the Keyboard ISR (@KBD_ISR):

Modify the interrupt service routine in loader_keyboard_routines.asm (or move it to a new kernel-specific include).
Instead of just printing the character, the ISR should:
Read the key from the keyboard device.
If it's a normal character, add it to the circular buffer and echo it to the screen.
If it's the backspace key, remove the last character from the buffer and update the screen to erase it.
If it's the return key, add a newline character to the buffer to signal the end of the line.
Create a SYS_READLINE System Call:

Define a new system call number for SYS_READLINE.
Write the handler for this system call inside the kernel's system call dispatcher.
This handler will loop, reading characters out of the circular buffer until it finds a newline character.
It should copy the line of text into a memory address provided by the calling program.
Update the Kernel's Command Interpreter:

Modify the main loop in os_kernel.asm.
Instead of whatever method it uses now, it should call the new SYS_READLINE system call to get a line of input from the user.
Once it receives a line, it can then parse the command and execute it as before.
This feature is a satisfying and manageable project that will make your Stern-XT operating system feel much more like a real, interactive system.
