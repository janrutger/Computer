i like to work on the ISA Assembler to make sure its beable to assemble multiple sourcefiles


the compiling of the multiple files must be done by one assembler instance
because the assebler keeps track of the symboltable

at init fase of the compiler the var_start pointer is given, so the assembler know where to place memory allocations
each sourcefile has an starting adres, this adres is an argumnet for the current assemble method. this must be configurble to.


the __main__ of the ISA assemblr.py is subject to change

it must compile the multiple sourcefiles to one single program.bin file
like it does now for an single sourcefiles

when a sourcefile is compiled, the restore flag (true/false),
is to remain the current symboltable, or to restore the previous one


it must be an easy and simple solution to make the ISA compiler doeing multiple sourcefiles based on a build config file

The build config file contains: the output filename, var_start adres, sourcefiles and per sourcefile the base/start adres of that file and if the assembler must remain, or restore the symboltable

 build.json file is present in the bin folder


 now i want to change the main, so the main writes the binary, bin file not the generate_binary method
