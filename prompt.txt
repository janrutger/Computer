This current project is the basis for the next step in this project

the next step is to create a simple interpreter language for the Stern-XT

On the commandline you can start the interpreter.
with is basicly an line edit function to write and edit an program and the program can be started from Hereâ€™s

when exit the interpretor, you come back on the commandline


the current project is the base of this step
its includes the commandline as basis

the language is an RPN based language
it uses integers, operations like /*-+, logical operations == != > <, an IF and an Jump statement


the sourcecode for the interpreter must be in a include file, called by the os_kernel.asm and used kernel_cliV4.asm

Interpreter Development Plan

The goal is to build an RPN interpreter on top of the existing OS. 
The foundation for this is already in place and should be reused. 
kernel_cliV4.asm provides the line editor, parser, and command dispatcher. 
It also contains the crucial @is_numeric routine for string-to-integer conversion. 
The DATASTACK itself is defined in os_loader.asm. 
kernel_runtime.asm provides the essential @push_A and @pop_A routines. 
The @rt_add function serves as a perfect template for all other arithmetic handlers. 
The main task is to create a new interpreter.asm file for the core logic. 
This file will contain the handlers for all the new RPN operators. 
Finally, extend the command table in kernel_cliV4 to integrate these new functions.

the baisc are working, some questions. 
i think the interpreter mainloop should not reuse the cmd buffer, but a lager program buffer, for now 512. 
and we need line numbers instead of an prompt i believe.
