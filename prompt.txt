This current project is the basis for the next step in this project

the next step is to create a simple interpreter language for the Stern-XT

On the commandline you can start the interpreter.
with is basicly an line edit function to write and edit an program and the program can be started from Hereâ€™s

when exit the interpretor, you come back on the commandline


the current project is the base of this step
its includes the commandline as basis

the language is an RPN based language
it uses integers, operations like /*-+, logical operations == != > <, an IF and an Jump statement


the sourcecode for the interpreter must be in a include file, called by the os_kernel.asm and used kernel_cliV4.asm

Interpreter Development Plan

The goal is to build an RPN interpreter on top of the existing OS. 
The foundation for this is already in place and should be reused. 
kernel_cliV4.asm provides the line editor, parser, and command dispatcher. 
It also contains the crucial @is_numeric routine for string-to-integer conversion. 
The DATASTACK itself is defined in os_loader.asm. 
kernel_runtime.asm provides the essential @push_A and @pop_A routines. 
The @rt_add function serves as a perfect template for all other arithmetic handlers. 
The main task is to create a new interpreter.asm file for the core logic. 
This file will contain the handlers for all the new RPN operators. 
Finally, extend the command table in kernel_cliV4 to integrate these new functions.

The STACKS interpreter initializes a program buffer and line index array. 
It displays a welcome message and then enters a main loop. 
This loop continuously prompts with line numbers, handles character input, 
and stores typed lines into the program buffer. Each line is null-terminated upon entry. 
The interpreter tracks line start addresses in the LINE_INDEX_ARRAY and increments the 
line number for subsequent input. 
Currently, it does not process or execute any commands; 
it solely functions as a line-numbered text input and storage mechanism. 
A helper routine is included for printing numbers.


the interpreter need support for commands, like (l)ist, e(x)it, (r)un. 
the idea is when you on an empty line, press <ESC> +l for list

Given kernel_cliV4.asm's existing RPN evaluation, the best place for STACKS-specific commands (list, run, exit) is still within interpreter.asm (extending stacks_handle_esc).

This maintains encapsulation, keeping STACKS self-contained with direct access to its data. 
The RUN command (and others needing RPN evaluation) can call a dedicated @execute_stacks_line routine within interpreter.asm, 
which then leverages kernel_cliV4.asm's RPN services. 
This cleanly separates concerns: kernel_cliV4.asm provides low-level RPN evaluation, 
while interpreter.asm manages the STACKS environment and its high-level commands. 
Integrating these into kernel_cliV4.asm would break modularity, create ambiguity, and complicate context management.
