### Game Design Document: "Escape the Box"

#### 1. Core Concept

"Escape the Box" is a single-player arcade game. 
The player is confined within a U-shaped arena and must collect coins to earn points. 
These points can then be spent to break through sections of the arena's walls to escape.

#### 2. Gameplay Loop

The core gameplay loop is centered on risk and reward:
1.  The player collects a moving coin to accumulate points.
2.  The player can attempt to break through a wall segment by colliding with it.
3.  If the player has enough points, the wall segment is destroyed, and the points are deducted from their score.
4.  If the player does not have enough points, they are penalized by the full cost of the wall, potentially putting their score into a negative "debt" state.
5.  The coin is reused, respawning in a new location each time it is collected.

#### 3. Key Features

*   **Dynamic Difficulty:** 
    A dynamic difficulty system will be implemented. 
    As the player collects more coins, the coin will begin to move faster, but it will also award more points upon collection, 
    increasing both the challenge and the reward.
*   **Variable Pricing:** 
    Different wall segments will have different point costs to break, 
    forcing the player to make strategic decisions about their escape route. 
    The main "roof" tile will be the most expensive exit.
*   **Random Movement:** 
    The Stacks's `RND` (random) function will be used to determine the respawn location of the coin, 
    and potentially the movement of a future "monster" tile, ensuring each playthrough feels slightly different.

#### 4. Level Design and Asset Strategy

*   **Layout:** 
    The level will be designed as an open, upside-down U-shape, using the bottom of the screen as the "floor" of the box. 
    This creates a defined play area without requiring tiles for all four sides.
*   **Player and Coin:** 
    For simplicity of design and collision, both the player and the coin will be represented by simple 1x1 tile sprites.
*   **Special Tile:** 
    The reserved tile (ID 7) for the "golden coin" or "monster" will use a larger 2x2 sprite. 
    This makes the reward easier to find when in debt, and the monster a more significant obstacle to avoid when in credit.
*   **Composite Walls:** 
    To efficiently use the limited number of dynamic tiles, the walls will be constructed from composite sprites 
    (e.g., 1xN or Nx1 shapes) rather than individual 1x1 blocks. The top wall will be a single tile with an 11x1 sprite, 
    creating an effective 9-tile wide play area.
*   **Segmented Walls:** 
    To enhance gameplay, the vertical walls will each be composed of two separate tile segments 
    (e.g., a small, cheap segment and a larger, more expensive one), providing multiple breakout options.

#### 5. Resource Management (Tile Budget)

The game will be designed within the engine's 8-tile limit. The planned allocation is as follows:
*   **Total Tiles Used:** 7
*   **Tiles Remaining:** 1 (goldencoin/monster)

This leaves one tile available for a future feature, such as a hidden "golden coin" that appears after a certain score is reached, 
or a "monster" tile that acts as a moving obstacle.

#### 6. Tile ID Bookkeeping

To ensure the game logic is clear and easy to manage, the following Tile ID allocation will be used:
*   **ID 0:** Player
*   **ID 1:** Coin
*   **ID 2:** Top Wall (most expensive)
*   **IDs 3, 4:** Left Wall segments
*   **IDs 5, 6:** Right Wall segments
*   **ID 7:** Reserved for the Monster or Golden Coin

#### 7. User Interface (UI) and Player Feedback

To provide essential feedback to the player, the current score will be displayed on-screen at all times.

*   **Display Method:** 
    As the engine operates in a sprite-based graphics mode, the score will not be rendered as text. 
    Instead, it will be constructed from a set of dedicated digit sprites (0-9).
*   **Layout:** 
    The score will be displayed in a fixed position outside of the main play area 
    (e.g., the top-left corner of the screen) to ensure it is always visible and does not interfere with gameplay.
*   **Implementation:** 
    This will require a new helper function that can take the numerical `score` variable, separate it into individual digits, 
    and draw the corresponding sprite for each digit at the correct screen location. 
    (we gonne ask the system architect where to put this helper function)




SOME IMPLEMENTATION NOTES TO REMEMBER

Based on the positions of your walls and roof, we first need to define the boundaries of the playable area.

The Roof is at Y=34.
The Left Wall is at X=26.
The Right Wall is at X=52.
The Floor is the bottom of the screen at Y=59.
This means the valid, playable area for a 1x1 tile is:

X-Range: from 27 to 51
Y-Range: from 35 to 58


Calculation random X Y values
RND 25 * 999 // 27 + AS newX
RND 24 * 999 // 35 + AS newY
