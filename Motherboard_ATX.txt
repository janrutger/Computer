now i have an pipelined CPU, the Stern motherboard should be upgraded to make better use of the new CPU
lets call it the Stern-ATX (Advanced Turbo eXecution) motherboard, instead of AT (advanced Threading)


the new motherboard should be binary compatible for both CPU. but it replaces the "asynchronous" threading model with a Synchronous Burst model.


The core of the change, the CPU thread is removed. instead of the thread
- the main() runs a burst of CPU ticks
- Ticks the divices
- Draw the screen and console
- include an sleep(0)for housekeeping by the host computer
- make sure an debug mode is still working


please reflect on the question if this advise of Gemini Snel is really a good idea
and will it give  better (wall-clock) performane
