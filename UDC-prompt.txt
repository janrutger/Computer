Universal Device Controler to manage multiple devices, and device type in the Stern-XT envroinment
devices can be eg an Plotter, or an sensor


each device is connected via the Universal Device Controler (UDC) to the Stern-XT architecture
a device has an device-type and an configurable channel ID, The channel ID must match to the UDC channel, where the device is "connected" to
The device-type is used by the UDC for derterming the right (sub) commandset for this device type

the commandset includes device specifik instructions, like 
- reset (to reset the device)
- new   (to start an new plot on a plotter)
- plot  (when the payload containt data to plot)
- color (setting the collor of the dot)

- aquare    (to read an value from an senortype device)

and generic instruction, like
- init      (to get the device type)
- online    (when a channel is activated by the host)
- offline   (when a channel is deactivated by the host)


when a CPU tries to use an invalid instruction for this device-type, the controller flags the CPU for this
And all communication to/from the device starts at the CPU side


At power on all devices start in an off-line idle mode 
During startup (boot time) the CPU sends an INIT to the, by the CPU known, channels and is waiting for the device type descriptor for this channel
when the device type matches the expected device for this channel, the CPU can send an online instruction and the device is then waiting for instrcutructions
while sending an off-line, the device will go in sleeping mode, and is not accepting any new instructions. 


the UDC is commuinication with the CPU via memory-maped-IO, herefore it has several reserved registers
at least:
- Channel register 
- status register(s)
- command register(s)
- a devicerype register per channel (8 channels in our design)
- dataregister(s)

to ensure we are not running in timing issues the UDC hols chache memory for the CPU communication and the cache hold an send and a receivebuffer(s) per channel


When the UDC communicates to to an device it send an packets with includes and instructionfield (reset, plot, ...) and an datafield
(since this is python code it can be an dictionary)

During boottime the CPU checks every known channels and checks if the devicetype is the expected divicetype for that channel.
So upstream instructions/routines can rely on the fact that devices are on a pre-agrreed channel


Clock tick wise, the UDC and the devices are ticking from the Stern-XT mainloop, with is also drivng the screen, keyboard and the Virtualdisk

for the plotter i (like to) use the MAtplotlib library, becuase this can do the heavy lifting of (re)scaling
But i also must work together wich the pygame library with runs the screen
With an Proof of Concept plotterPOC.py, with i temperaly plugged into the Stern-XT.py proofs it will work
