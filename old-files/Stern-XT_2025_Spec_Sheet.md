## âœ¨ Core Architecture: The Dynamic Execution Engine

At the heart of the Stern-XT lies a radically flexible Central Processing Unit, engineered for unparalleled customization.

-   **ðŸ§  Reconfigurable ISA Core (CPU)**: Forget fixed instruction sets. The Stern-XT CPU is driven by a dynamic microcode engine. Leverage our toolchain to define up to 90 custom instructions, effectively creating your own processor architecture on the fly.

-   **âš¡ Unified Memory Fabric**: A high-throughput, 16KB memory space is at your command. The pre-optimized memory map ensures peak performance by allocating dedicated zones for the OS kernel, user applications, and a zero-latency, direct-mapped video buffer for the 80x24 text console.

-   **ðŸ”Œ Plug-and-Play Device Bus (UDC)**: The Universal Device Controller provides a standardized, channel-based interface for seamless integration of a growing suite of peripherals. Hot-plug new devices into your ecosystem with minimal overhead.

## ðŸš€ Integrated Peripheral Suite

Extend the core functionality with our suite of powerful, UDC-compliant hardware modules.

-   **ðŸ’¾ Persistent Storage via VirtualDisk**: Leverage an on-demand, persistent storage solution. The VirtualDisk subsystem provides robust file I/O operations (Create, Read, Write, Close) through a secure, hash-based file identification protocol.

-   **ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Visualization Engine (Y-Plotter)**: Stream data directly from your applications to the Y-Plotter and transform raw numbers into insightful, real-time graphics. Perfect for analytics and data visualization tasks.

-   **ðŸŽ¨ Pixel-Perfect Rendering (Virtual LCD)**: Unleash your creative vision on a high-resolution 640x480 display. 
    -   **16-Color Gamut**: Rich, vibrant colors for complex visuals.
    -   **Dual-Mode Rendering**: Choose between granular, single-pixel control or hardware-accelerated 8x8 sprite rendering.
    -   **Flicker-Free Animation**: Leverage the integrated double-buffering and `FLIP` command for silky-smooth animations.

## ðŸ’» Next-Gen DevX & Tooling

The Stern-XT platform is built for developers. We provide a seamless, end-to-end workflow from concept to execution.

-   **Stacks: The Native Language for Hardware Synthesis**:
    - A high-level, stack-oriented language designed for rapid prototyping and direct hardware interaction.
    - Features a **Dual-Mode Interpreter**: Iterate quickly in the interactive REPL, then deploy complex applications with the bytecode compiler for maximum performance.
    - Includes the `&io` command for frictionless, high-level access to the entire UDC peripheral ecosystem.

-   **The Genesis Toolchain**:
    -   **Microcode Assembler**: Forge your own reality. This is where you define the soul of your machine, creating the very instructions the CPU will execute.
    -   **Adaptive ISA Assembler**: This intelligent assembler dynamically ingests your custom CPU architecture, providing a seamless assembly experience for any instruction set you can imagine.

-   **Deep-Dive Debugger**:
    -   Achieve full-stack observability with our integrated command-line debugger.
    -   Enjoy granular execution control, from the **micro-op level** (`microstep`) to full instructions (`step`).
    -   Manage breakpoints and inspect the entire system state to resolve issues with unprecedented speed and clarity.
