Here is a breakdown of the steps you outlined, confirming that you are on the right track:

Define the Data Structures ("Stacks"):

Library Registry: A set of tables ($LIB_REGISTRY_HASH_TABLE, $LIB_REGISTRY_ADRES_TABLE)
to hold the name and _init address of each library. 
size of 4 is a good starting point for your built-in ROM libraries.

External Function Table: A set of tables ($LIB_FUNCTION_HASH_TABLE, $LIB_FUNCTION_ADRES_TABLE) 
to hold the name and absolute execution address of the individual library 
functions/methods. 
A size of 32 is a reasonable choice, allowing for a good number of total external 
functions across all libraries.




Create a Library Registration Routine:

This routine needs to be part of your operating system's startup sequence, likely in os_loader.asm as you said.
Its job is to populate the "Library Registry" (from step 1) with the details of all the libraries that are pre-loaded in the ROM.
Implement the USE Instruction:

Add a new ~use token to your language.
In kernel_stacks.asm, modify the immediate-mode executor (@_executed_immediate) to recognize the ~use token.
The handler for USE will look up the library name in the "Library Registry", get the _init address, and call it. This triggers the library to register all its individual methods.
Modify the Execution Logic:

Update the function execution routine (:3_execute_unknown_token_smart) to perform a chained search.
Search 1: Look for the called function name in the internal function table ($FUNCTION_HASH_TABLE).
Search 2: If not found, look for it in the "External Function Table" ($LIB_FUNCTION_HASH_TABLE).
If found in the external table, execute it using a native callx to its absolute address.
If it's not found in either table, then it's an "unknown word" error.
You have laid out the correct, complete, and logical sequence of steps. Following this plan will result in the powerful and flexible library system you've envisioned.

### Implementation Notes & Conventions (ToAdd)
---

**1. Direct Call for Registration (No Syscall):**
   - The library `_init` functions are trusted code within the ROM.
   - Therefore, they should register their methods by using a direct `CALL` to a public kernel routine (e.g., `@register_external_word`), not by using a `SYSCALL`. This is simpler and more efficient.

**2. Example: Registering a Built-in Library in `os_loader.asm`:**
   - Your OS loader will need a routine to populate the `$LIB_REGISTRY`.

   ```stern-asm
   @register_builtin_libraries
       ; Register the 'turtle' library
       PUSH <HASH_OF("turtle")>
       PUSH @turtle_lib_init ; Address of the library's init function
       CALL @add_to_library_registry

       ; Register the 'sound' library
       PUSH <HASH_OF("sound")>
       PUSH @sound_lib_init
       CALL @add_to_library_registry
       RET

   @add_to_library_registry
       ; Pops address and hash, adds them to the registry tables
       ; ...
       RET
   ```

**3. Example: A Library's `_init` Function:**
   - Each library must provide an `_init` function that registers its own public methods.

   ```stern-asm
   -- turtle_lib.asm
   @turtle_lib_init
       ; Register the 'forward' method
       PUSH <HASH_OF("forward")>
       PUSH @turtle_forward_method
       CALL @register_external_word ; The public kernel routine

       ; Register the 'turn' method
       PUSH <HASH_OF("turn")>
       PUSH @turtle_turn_method
       CALL @register_external_word
       RET

   @turtle_forward_method
       ; ... code for 'forward' ...
       RET

   @turtle_turn_method
       ; ... code for 'turn' ...
       RET
   ```

**4. Token Definition:**
   - Remember to add `~use` to your token definition file (e.g., `kernel_command_definitions.asm`) and ensure the tokenizer recognizes it.

**5. Error Handling:**
   - The `USE` command handler will need a new error routine (`@error_unknown_library`) for when a user tries to `USE` a library name that isn't in the registry.
