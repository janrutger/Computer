In this project i gone try to simutale cell-growth or the grow of veins in a leaf
herefore we need a alghoritme for the calculations

This is my idea.


We using an 480x640 Turtle screen
Each cell has the size (radius) of two and color green
each Auxin had the size (radius) of two, and color is red


we trace (for now) 200 itterations of growing
we use max 20 auxins per itterations


We start with 1 root cell (x,y) and place this on the screen.
each cell has an position(x,y) and an direction(x,y)
Then we check is the number of auxins is less the 21 (20 max), if leq 20, create 5 auxins, to an max of 20


at this point we have:
- one dict for the cells, containing 1 (the root) cell
- one dict for auxins, containing 5 auxins cells



REPEAT 200 times:
    Reset the direction(x,y) of all cells to (0,0)

    we itterate over the auxins, and find the closed cell
        if:     the distance to the cell is smaller then 20, the auxin 'dies' and is removed from the auxins dict
        else:   add the vector (auxin - cell) to the cell's direction(x,y)

    we itterate over the cells
        if direction is not (0,0), normalize it and create a new cell attached to the current one

    And we check the number of auxins if leq 20 generate (max) 5 auxins, to an max of 20
END


HEAP uses
Objects (Payload):
200 Cells * 5 words (Type, X, Y, DirX, DirY) = 1000 words
20 Auxins * 3 words (Type, X, Y) = 60 words

Dictionaries (Containers):
(200 Cells + 20 Auxins) * 2 words (Key+Value) = 440 words
+ 4 words headers

Total Heap = 1504 words
